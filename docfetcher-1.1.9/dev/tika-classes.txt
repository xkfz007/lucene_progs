DocFetcher makes use of the RTF parser from Apache Tika 1.0. The following is a complete list of all the classes that were imported from Tika to satisfy the RTF parser dependencies:

1) All classes in the package org.apache.tika.parser.rtf.

2) All classes in the following packages:
  * org.apache.tika.exception
  * org.apache.tika.io
  * org.apache.tika.metadata
  * org.apache.tika.sax

3) The following classes:
  * org.apache.tika.mime.MediaType
  * org.apache.tika.parser.AbstractParser
  * org.apache.tika.parser.ParseContext
  * org.apache.tika.parser.Parser
  * org.apache.tika.utils.CharsetUtils

Additionally, two instances of the assertion "assert param == 0;" were removed from the class org.apache.tika.parser.rtf.TextExtractor in order to fix a crash on RTF files created by TextMaker. See: http://sourceforge.net/p/docfetcher/discussion/702424/thread/8a3dd4f6/
