Step 1: Install Java Runtime
==================================
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.6.0 or higher, is required. To find
out what JRE version you have, open a command prompt and type in
"java -version".

If Java 1.6.0 or higher is not available on your system, you can obtain it in
the following places:

* Windows: <http://java.com>
* Linux: In the official software repository of your distribution.
* Mac OS&nbsp;X: <http://www.apple.com/support/>


Step 2: Install DocFetcher ${version}
=====================================

For a list of changes from previous releases, see the [changelog](http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php?id=changelog).

Between version 1.0.3 and version 1.1 beta 1, DocFetcher was rewritten from scratch, resulting in a large number of new features and changes. [This page](http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/wiki/doku.php?id=changes_in_v1.1) gives an overview of the most important ones.
