Building DocFetcher<br></h1><ul><li>Note:
The build process for DocFetcher that is described here involves
precompiled daemon executables, which can be found in resources/daemon.
If you don't mind the inevitable C/C++ build headaches and want to
recompile the daemons as well, follow the instructions in the 'The
daemons' section below.</li><li>There are two ways to build all DocFetcher releases <span style="font-style: italic;">except</span> for the Windows installer: First, if you want to build them inside
Eclipse, you&nbsp;have to import DocFetcher as a new
project into your Eclipse workspace by following the steps described in
the&nbsp;section&nbsp;"Setting up DocFetcher in Eclipse" (see below). The second option is to
install Ant without Eclipse and run the Ant build script from the command
line. See the documentation on the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant website</a> for more info.</li><li>
The Ant
build script requires an additional Ant task that isn't shipped with
the DocFetcher source, the AspectJ Tools. Download it from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/downloads.php">here</a>
and put the "aspectjtools.jar" file in it on the root directory of
the newly created DocFetcher project. Now you should be able to run the
Ant build script.</li><li>To build the Windows installer, boot into Windows, then:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Install <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a>.</li>
    <li>Install the NSIS plugin "Processes" by copying the Processes.dll file from <span style="font-family: monospace;">[DocFetcher folder]\dev</span> to the <span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Program Files\NSIS\Plugins</span> folder.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Execute build-win-installer.nsi. Important: The NSIS script must be run
<span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> running the Ant script, because the source code cannot be
compiled with NSIS alone.</li>
  </ul>
<li>The output of both build scripts will go to the build folder (which will be created if it doesn't exist).</li><li>To
increment the version number of DocFetcher, update the line "!define
VERSION ???" at the beginning of the NSIS script and the line
"&lt;property name="version" value="???"/&gt;" at the beginning of the
Ant script. The scripts will then take care of the rest.</li></ul><h1>Setting up DocFetcher in Eclipse<br>
</h1><ul>
<li>Download the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docfetcher">source code</a>
for DocFetcher if you haven't already.</li>
<li>Download <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse
3.4</a> or newer for your platform. Make sure you download the
"Eclipse Classic" edition.</li>
<li>Download the version of <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/">AJDT</a> (AspectJ
Development Tools) that matches your version of Eclipse. For Eclipse
3.4 this would be AJDT 1.6.x.</li>
<li>Install AJDT by extracting the package contents into the
Eclipse folder. See <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/gettingstarted.php">here</a>
for more information. Then run Eclipse with the command "eclipse
-clean" to install the AJDT plugin.</li>
<li>In the Eclipse menu, choose <span style="font-family: monospace;">File &gt; Import
&gt;
Existing Projects into Workspace</span>
and select the DocFetcher
source code package. Now a new project will be created. (Simply
unzipping the contents of the source code package into your Eclipse
workspace folder does NOT work.)</li></ul><h1>Running DocFetcher inside Eclipse</h1><ul>
<li>First, import DocFetcher as a new project into your Eclipse workspace
by following the steps described in the&nbsp;section&nbsp;"Setting up DocFetcher
in Eclipse".</li><li>Somewhere
in the Eclipse preferences you can set the JDK compliance level to
1.5.0. With a 1.6.0 compliance level Eclipse may refuse to compile the
program.</li>
<li>Set up the referenced libraries. Make sure the correct SWT
library is on the classpath. There's two of them, <span style="font-family: monospace;">swt-xxx-win32.jar</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">swt-xxx-linux-gtk.jar</span>.
If you're running on Windows, the first one should be on the classpath,
for Linux, it's the second one. It won't work if you have both of them
on the classpath.</li><ul><li>To remove a library from the classpath,
right-click on the appropriate jar file under the entry "Referenced
Libraries" in Eclipse's "Package" panel and select <span style="font-family: monospace;">Build Path &gt; Remove from Build Path</span>.</li><li>To add a library to the classpath, right-click on the jar file in the lib folder (also on the "Package" panel) and select <span style="font-family: monospace;">Build Path &gt; Add to Build Path</span>.</li></ul>
<li>Create a new run configuration: <span style="font-family: monospace;">Run &gt; Run
Configurations...</span>.</li><ul><li>The working directory of this configuration has to be set to
<span style="font-family: monospace;">DocFetcher/bin</span> (instead of <span style="font-family: monospace;">DocFetcher</span>), because the application will
look for the icons folder, which is located inside <span style="font-family: monospace;">DocFetcher/bin</span>. Now
try to run DocFetcher with this run configuration.</li><li>Also, the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">DocFetcher/resources/lang</span> folder must be on your classpath. Go
to the "Classpath" tab, click on "User Entries", then on the button
"Advanced..." to the right and add the lang folder to your classpath.
Without this folder, DocFetcher would complain that it cannot find some
"Resources" files.</li></ul><li>If you see an error message resembling this one: "<span style="font-family: monospace;">Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no
swt-gtk-3448 or swt-gtk in swt.library.path, java.library.path or the
jar file</span>" that means you haven't put the correct SWT library on your classpath.</li></ul><h1>The daemons</h1><h2>Setting up the daemons in Eclipse</h2><ul><li>First, you'll have install the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt">C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT)</a>,
a plugin for Eclipse to compile C/C++ projects. Then set up the build
toolchain by following the instructions on the first page(s) of this
section of Eclipse's Help System: <span style="font-family: monospace;">Help &gt; Help Contents &gt; C/C++ Development&nbsp;User Guide</span>.</li><li>The
source code for the two daemons (Linux, Windows) ships with the
DocFetcher source code package. However, you'll have to import them as
separate Eclipse projects.</li><ul><li>From the Eclipse menu select: <span style="font-family: monospace;">File &gt; Import&nbsp;&gt; Existing Projects into Workspace</span></li><li>In
"Select root directory" enter the folder where the daemon source code
can be found. For Windows, this is the folder "src-daemon/win32", for
Linux, it's "src-daemon/linux".</li><li>Check the option "Copy projects into workspace".</li></ul><li>Select the daemon project in the package view, then, from the Eclipse menu, select <span style="font-family: monospace;">Project &gt; Build Project</span>.</li></ul><h2>Compiling the daemons with Ant</h2><ul><li>There's a file named 'build-daemon.xml' on the project root. Note that this script uses a modified version of the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ant-contrib/">cpptasks 1.0 beta 5</a> ant task. The modification is based on the patch posted on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=1576291&amp;group_id=36177&amp;atid=416920">this bug tracker item</a>.</li><li>Make
sure you have a C++ compiler installed. (If you've successfully set up
the CDT plugin, then you already got a C++ compiler.)</li><li>Install <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>
for your OS, then run this script with the following command from the
terminal: "ant -f build-daemon.xml". If you're on Windows, you'll have
to put the parent folder of the ant executable on your 'PATH' (a
so-called environment variable).</li><li>Depending
on whether this script is run on Windows or Linux, it will generate
either a Windows or a Linux daemon in the build folder.</li></ul><h1>What's inside&nbsp;all the folders</h1><ul><li>project root: This file, the build scripts and files related to the build scripts (i.e. Ant tasks).</li><li>src: The source code for DocFetcher.</li><li>src-daemon: The source code for the daemons.</li><li>resources: Everything that will be shipped with the release builds.</li><ul><li>deb: Files related to the debian package.</li><li>daemon: Precompiled daemon executables</li><li>help: The manual.</li><li>icons: The image files used by the program.</li><li>lang: Translations of the GUI.</li><li>licenses: License information for all libraries used.</li><li>portable: Files related to the portable version.</li><li>windows: Files related to the Windows version.</li></ul><li>build:
This is where the output of the build scripts goes to. Warning: Don't
put anything of value into this folder, it will be deleted when running
the Ant build script.</li><li>dev:
Development related resources, such as Python scripts and&nbsp;vector
graphics.&nbsp;The Python scripts should be run from a command prompt
and are used for analyzing and safely manipulating certain parts
of&nbsp;the source code. Each of them contains some descriptive lines
at the beginning.</li><li>lib: All libraries used by DocFetcher, including native libraries (*.so and *.dll).</li><li>website: The files the <a href="http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/">project website</a> consists of.</li></ul></div>
