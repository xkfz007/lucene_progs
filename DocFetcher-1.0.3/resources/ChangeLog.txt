2010-01-19 - DocFetcher 1.0.2

Bugfixes:

  * When the installed Linux version crashed, it unsuccessfully tried to write the stacktrace to /usr/share/docfetcher. This has been corrected to ~/.docfetcher.
  * Bug #2792186: Crash because DocFetcher was trying to display a message box when there's no active shell.
