</div>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>DocFetcher is an Open Source desktop
search application: It
allows you to search the contents of documents on your computer. - You can
think of it as Google for your local document repository.</p>
<p><small>(Hint:
If you're reading this document inside DocFetcher and prefer to read it
in your web browser instead, click on the "Open in external
browser" button right above this panel.)</small></p>
<p><span class="p-label">Create an index</span>:
Right-click on the "Search
Scope" panel on the left and select "Create Index..." Now
choose a folder to be indexed. For starters, this should be a small one with not too
many files in it, like, say, 50? After selecting the folder,
a configuration window pops up. The default&nbsp;configuration
should
suffice, so just click on the "Run" button and wait until DocFetcher
has finished indexing the documents.</p><p>Alternatively, you could drag a folder
out of your file manager and drop it on the "Search
Scope" panel. Another
way of creating indexes is rightclicking on a folder in your file
manager. This is described below, under the section "Notable Features".</p>
<p><span class="p-label">Perform a search</span>:
Enter a search term in
the&nbsp;text box above the result panel (the table with the column
headers) and hit Enter. The search results will be displayed in the
result panel and split up into pages if the number of results exceeds a
certain limit.
You can navigate through the pages using the arrow buttons to the right
of the text box you've entered the search term in.</p>
<p><span class="p-label">Filter or sort the results</span>:
You may enter
some values into
the
"Minimum / Maximum Filesize" box to filter out files with a file size
below the minimum and/or above the maximum value. You can also
check or uncheck items in the "Filetypes" and "Search
Scope" panel to filter out certain file types or files in
specific folders. Click on the column headers of the result panel to
sort the results by the chosen criterion.</p>
<p><span class="p-label">The preview panel</span>:
Below
(or to the right of) the result panel you can find the preview panel,
which provides a text-only preview with search term highlighting,
and, for HTML documents, a simple built-in web browser in addition to
that. (<a href="DocFetcher_Manual_files/XULRunner.html">You
might have to install it first.</a>)</p>
<p><small>(If
you are reading this inside DocFetcher, following the instructions in
the next paragraph will make this manual disappear. You
can either open it in an external browser with the "Open in external
browser" button or restore it later with the '?' button.)</small></p>
<p><span class="p-label">Open a document</span>:
Double-click on one
of the items on
the result panel if you think you've found what you've been looking
for. By default, DocFetcher will automatically hide in the System Tray
after opening a file. DocFetcher will also hide in the System Tray
if you click on the "Minimize to system tray" button. To bring it
back, either click on the System Tray icon or press the "global hotkey"
(Ctrl + F8 by default).</p>
<p><span class="p-label">Index updates</span>: If documents in the
document repository are added, removed or modified, the corresponding
indexes have to be updated. This is done automatically in two ways: (1)
If DocFetcher is running, it detects the changes and updates the
indexes immediately. (2) If DocFetcher isn't running, the changes are
detected by a small daemon program that runs in the background; then
the affected indexes are updated the next time DocFetcher starts.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Note</span>: If you are
using the portable version of DocFetcher and want the
daemon to be run automatically on startup, you have to manually add the
daemon executable(s) to your operating system's list of startup programs.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don't index entire drives</span>:
In contrast to other desktop search applications (e.g. Google Desktop),
DocFetcher was not designed for&nbsp;indexing entire harddrives (e.g.
"C:\"), and may explode if you attempt to do so. DocFetcher expects
that you index only what you actually need, which saves both time and
diskspace, and also gives much better search results.</p>
<h1>Notable Features<br>
</h1>
<p><span class="p-label">Portable document repository</span>:
The portable version of DocFetcher
allows you to bundle up DocFetcher, your documents and their associated
indexes into a single folder, which you can then&nbsp;move around
freely, e.g. to removable media,&nbsp;encrypted volumes or other
computers. This can
also be used for sharing a single document repository across a local
area network or across the OS'es of a Windows/Linux dual boot system. <a href="DocFetcher_Manual_files/Portable_Repositories.html">Details.</a></p>
<p><span class="p-label">Launch DocFetcher on a
folder by rightclicking on it</span>:
Sometimes it would be quite
convenient to perform a full-text search on a folder just by
rightclicking on it in the file manager, without creating any index
files. DocFetcher offers a feature (you might call it "temporary
indexes") that comes very close to that. Note that this requires manual
installation if you're using the Linux and/or portable version of
DocFetcher. See <a href="DocFetcher_Manual_files/Shell_Integration.html">here</a> for more.</p>
<p><span class="p-label">Detection of
HTML pairs</span>:
Pairs of HTML files and associated folders (e.g.&nbsp;"foo.htm"
and "foo_files") can be treated as a single document. See <a href="DocFetcher_Manual_files/HTML_Pair_Detection.html">here</a>
for a
description of how this works, the rare situations where it might not
work, and&nbsp;how to avoid these situations.</p><span class="p-label">Customizable
text&nbsp;file
extensions</span>: You can specify which files should be indexed
as
plain text. This feature may be useful for programmers who want to
index
source code files.&nbsp;HTML file extensions can be customized also.<br>

<p><span class="p-label">Indexing multiple
folders at once</span>:
There is an "Add folder to queue"
button on the top right of the indexing configuration window that
allows putting several folders in a queue, in which they will be
processed one after another.</p>
<p><span class="p-label">Excluding
certain files from indexing</span>: You can exclude certain files
from indexing by entering one or more regular expression based filename
patterns. <a href="DocFetcher_Manual_files/Skip_Files_Regex.html">Details</a>.</p>
