<h1>Portable Document Repositories</h1><h2>What is the portable version of DocFetcher?</h2><ul><li>Can be obtained from the <a href="http://docfetcher.sourceforge.net/download.html">project website</a>.</li><li>No installation: You simply extract the contents of the downloaded archive into a folder.</li><li>Can be run from both Windows and Linux using the respective launchers (.exe/.bat, .sh)</li><li>If
you put all documents to be indexed into the DocFetcher folder or
subfolders of that folder (except for the 'indexes' folder), you
can freely move around your entire document repository complete with DocFetcher and the indexes.<br></li></ul><h2>What it is good for</h2><ul><li>You
can keep the whole document repository complete with DocFetcher and
indexes even after reinstalling your operating system and moving the repository to a different place.</li><li>You can easily move your document repository to another computer.</li><li>You can put your document repository on a CD-ROM (archiving?), a USB drive or other removable media.</li><li>You can put it into an encrypted volume (recommended:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a>).</li><li>A
single document repository can be shared across&nbsp;a local area
network, even if there's a mix of Linux and Windows computers.</li><li>You can use a single document repository on a Windows/Linux dual boot system.</li></ul><h2>Usability tips</h2><ul><li>Just common sense, but still: If you put DocFetcher on a CD-ROM, you
won't be able to save changes to the preferences or the indexes, so
remember to properly configure&nbsp;everything before burning it to the CD-ROM.</li><li>Since
DocFetcher is a Java program,&nbsp;it can only be run on computers on
which a Java Runtime Environment, version 1.6.0 or newer, is installed.
Thus, if you intend to create a CD-ROM archive of your repository, you
would probably want to include a Java Runtime Environment installer (or
two if you're working with both Windows and Linux).</li><li>Juggling with multiple instances of DocFetcher can be made less confusing by setting alternative program window titles
for some of these instances. Just open the "user.properties" file with
a text editor and enter an alternative title on the "AppName=" line.</li></ul><h2>Limitations</h2><ul><li>You
can run multiple instances of the same DocFetcher installation at the
same time. However, in the current version of DocFetcher the instance
that terminates last will override all changes made by instances that
terminated earlier. Therefore, if you want to make some changes
(to the preferences or indexes)
from an instance A, either make sure A is the last one that terminates,
or make sure A is the only instance with write permission.</li><li>As
mentioned above, the document repository will NOT be fully portable if
some of its documents are somewhere outside the DocFetcher
folder.&nbsp;The reason is that DocFetcher can&nbsp;use relative file
paths instead of absolute ones only if the documents are all located in its
own folder.</li><li>Documents
inside the 'indexes' folder will not be indexed. (In fact, you
shouldn't put anything into that folder, because it might be
deleted!)</li><li>Beware
of filename incompatibilities between Linux and Windows. For example,
on Linux filenames can contain characters such as ":" or "|", but on
Windows they can't. As a result, you can only move a document
repository from Linux to Windows or in the opposite direction if it
doesn't contain documents with incompatible filenames. Oh, and special
characters such as German umlauts are an entirely different matter...</li></ul></div>
