<h1 id="title">How the
HTML pair detection works</h1>
DocFetcher
tries to detect whether a certain HTML document has an associated
folder, and if so, it treats them as a single document. The main reason
for including this feature was to hide files&nbsp;inside&nbsp;HTML
folders, which sometimes pollute the result lists.
The
detection mechanism used imitates the mechanism found in Microsoft
Windows 2000/ME/XP, which is explained <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/252721/en-us">here</a>.
Here's a brief summary: For every folder that has one of the following
suffixes:<br>
<ul>
<li>_archivos</li>
<li>_arquivos</li>
<li>_bestanden</li>
<li>_bylos</li>
<li>-Dateien</li>
<li>_datoteke</li>
<li>_dosyalar</li>
<li>_elemei</li>
<li>_failid</li>
<li>_fails</li>
<li>_fajlovi</li>
<li>_ficheiros</li>
<li>_fichiers</li>
<li>-filer</li>
<li>.files</li>
<li>_files</li>
<li>_file</li>
<li>_fitxers</li>
<li>_fitxategiak</li>
<li>_pliki</li>
<li>_soubory</li>
<li>_tiedostot</li>
</ul>
DocFetcher
checks whether there's an HTML file with a matching filename. If so,
the folder and the file will be treated as a single document. For
example, if there's a folder named "foo_files", DocFetcher checks if
there's a corresponding file with the name "foo.html", "foo.htm",
"foo.shtml", "foo.shtm", and so on. Most of the time, the pairing will
be unambiguous, but as you can already see, there are some rare
occasions where this mechanism doesn't work:<br>
<ul>
<li>What if
DocFetcher encounters these files: "foo.htm", "foo.html" and
"foo_files"? It will associate the folder with one of the two HTML
files, but which one it chooses is undefined.</li>
<li>What about
"foo.htm", "foo_files" and "foo-Dateien"? Here, one of the two folders
will be associated with the HTML file, but the choice is undefined as
well.</li>
<li>Or imagine this situation: "foo.htm", "foo.html",
"foo_files", "foo-Dateien". Which file is connected to which folder?
Two associations will be made, but there's no guarantee whether they're
correct.</li>
</ul>
So here are some tips on how to organize your document repository in
order to avoid such problems:<br>
<ul>
<li>Rename your documents when ambiguity is around the corner.</li>
<li>Don't
name folders so that they look like HTML folders. Don't give them
names
like "journal_files", "office_files", etc. And a folder name like
"this_fails" can indeed lead to application failure, as indicated by
the name ("_fails" is an HTML folder suffix, see above).</li>
<li>Some multiple page documents (e.g. comprehensive
tutorials) downloaded from the web won't have that typical pair
structure. Instead, there'll be a start page named "index.htm" or
something like that, which points to the other pages. The pairing
mechanism described above obviously doesn't work here (no associations
are made), and often it's a better idea not to index these multiple
page documents at all, or at least index them in a separate index.</li>
</ul>
