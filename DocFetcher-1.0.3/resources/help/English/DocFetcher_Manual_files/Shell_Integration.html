<h1><span class="p-label">Launch DocFetcher on a
folder by rightclicking on it</span></h1>
<h2>How it works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of index-free full-text search, we chose to
implement "temporary indexes" , because the former would have been too
difficult to integrate with the existing program architecture.</li>
<li>Temporary indexes are created when you rightclick on a
folder in your file manager (e.g. Windows Explorer), and select "Search
With DocFetcher".</li>
<li>This will launch DocFetcher, and the selected folder is
automatically scheduled for indexing. All you need to do here is to
give the greenlight to the indexing by clicking on the "Run" button.
You can, of course, alter the indexing options first.</li>
<li>Wait until the indexing is completed.</li>
<li>Indexes that are created this way have a "delete on exit"
flag, and they are marked with an [X] in the Search Scope panel. This
flag indicates that the index will be removed after you leave the
program.</li>
<li>If you change your mind and decide to make a temporary
index permanent, rightclick on it in the Search Scope panel and select
"Toggle Deletion On Exit".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation on Windows</h2>
The "Search With DocFetcher" context menu entry is added automatically
if you installed DocFetcher with the Windows installer, and it is also
removed automatically after deinstallation. If you're using the
portable version on Windows, manual installation is required:<br>
<ul>
<li>To register the context menu entry, run DocFetcher in a
command prompt with the parameter "--register-contextmenu", e.g.: <span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Program
Files\DocFetcher\DocFetcher.exe --register-contextmenu</span></li>
<li>If you move the DocFetcher folder to a different place,
you'll have to re-register the context menu entry. The previous entry
will be overridden.</li>
<li>To unregister the context menu entry, run DocFetcher with
"--unregister-contextmenu", e.g.: <span style="font-family: monospace;">C:\Program
Files\DocFetcher\DocFetcher.exe --unregister-contextmenu</span></li>
<li>Note that the register and unregister operations are
language-dependent. That means, if you register the context menu entry,
and then switch to a different locale (e.g. English -&gt; German), the
unregister command will have no effect. You'll have to switch back to
previous locale to remove the context menu entry.
(Alternatively, you could just remove the "Search With DocFetcher"
entry in the Windows registry: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT -&gt; Directory -&gt;
shell -&gt; ...)<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>If you launch DocFetcher with a space-separated list of
directories as start parameters, right after startup DocFetcher will
put these directories in the indexing queue, and mark
them&nbsp;with the "delete on exit" flag. DocFetcher may reject
some of the parameters if they don't make sense (e.g. non-existent
directories). If a path contains whitespace characters, it must be put
in quotes.</p>
<p>So, in order to integrate DocFetcher with your file manager,
you'll have to figure out how to create a context menu entry in your
file manager that launches DocFetcher with the selected folders as
start parameters.</p>
<p>Here's how you can do it in Nautilus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the package 'nautilus-actions' (e.g. <span style="font-family: monospace;">sudo apt-get install
nautilus-actions</span>).</li>
<li>Go to 'Preferences &gt; Nautilus Actions
Configuration', click on 'Import/Export'.</li>
<li>Import the schema file that was shipped with DocFetcher.
Location of the schema file:</li>
<ul>
<li>Linux Debian package: /usr/share/docfetcher</li>
<li>Linux Portable: In the DocFetcher folder</li>
</ul>
<li>If you're using the portable version, you'll have to modify
the imported configuration a bit: Select the configuration, click on
'Edit' and&nbsp;adjust the path to the executable (DocFetcher.sh)
and the icon file (icons/docfetcher16.png). You'll have to do this
every time you move the DocFetcher folder.</li>
<li>To remove the context menu entry, simply delete it in the
'Nautilus Action Configuration'.<br>
</li>
</ul>
