<h1>Skipping files using regular expressions</h1><p>DocFetcher provides
a way to exclude certain files from indexing using regular expressions.
The regular expression(s) can be entered into the "Skip files" box on
the <a href="Indexing_Options.html">Indexing Options</a> dialog. The '$' character is used to separate two regular expressions.</p><p>This
may not be the right place for an in-depth discussion of regular
expressions (check Wikipedia for that), but a few practical examples
should suffice:</p><h2>Exclude all MS Excel files:&nbsp;.*\.xls</h2>The
"." stands for one unknown character. The "*" means "the preceding
character, zero or more times", so in this case ".*" stands for a
series of zero or more unknown characters. Since the "." is already
used as a special character, when we want to match the dot itself in a
filename, we have to <span style="font-style: italic;">escape</span>
it, by putting a "\" in front of it. The characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9
all stand for themselves. This is why ".*\.xls" matches filenames of
any length that end with a dot and the sequence "xls".<br><h2>Exclude some license text files: license\.txt $ License\.txt $ LICENSE\.txt</h2>As
mentioned above, the "$" character can be used to combine two or more
regular expressions. As a result, this pattern will exclude all files
with the name "license.txt", "License.txt" and "LICENSE.txt". Again,
the dot must be escaped because it's a special character.<br><h2>Matching a sequence of digits: journal[0-9]*\.doc</h2>Suppose
you want to exclude a set of Word documents that all start with
"journal" and end with a timestamp, like so:
journal2008.doc. Moreover, what you <span style="font-style: italic;">dont</span>
want is to exclude files like "journalism.doc". An expression like
"journal.*\.doc" isn't going to work, obviously. The solution is to
replace the "." with "[0-9]": While "." matches any character, "[0-9]"
matches one digit. Therefore "[0-9]*" will match a sequence of digits.<br><h2>Want more?</h2><p>Have a look at this <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">reference page</a> or read some of the myriad of regular expression tutorials on the web.</p><h2>Interaction between HTML pairing and file exclusion</h2><p>If
the HTML pairing is activated and DocFetcher encounters an HTML
file/folder pair, the exclusion patterns will be applied to the HTML
file only, not to files inside the associated HTML folder. In other
words, the exclusion mechanism doesn't work on files, but on whole
documents.</p></div>
